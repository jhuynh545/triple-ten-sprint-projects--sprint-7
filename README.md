# triple-ten-sprint-projects--sprint-7

Megaline, a mobile carrier, seeks to transition subscribers from legacy plans to their newer plans, Smart and Ultra. Your task is to develop a classification model that analyzes subscriber behavior and recommends the most suitable plan.

Using preprocessed behavior data from subscribers who have already switched to the new plans, your objective is to build a model that achieves an accuracy of at least 0.75. The model's performance will be validated using a test dataset to ensure its reliability in making accurate recommendations.
